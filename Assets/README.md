# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

I made a study guide to help focus study time on various different starter concepts. It will make it easier for students to know what to study by giving a brief outline of every topic. I learned that when feeling overwhelmed, it is important to jump in regardless. Things will begin to make more sense in time.
